# CREATION IN WEB APPLICATION FOR TEST ENVIRONMENT

## AIM
 To Creation in Web Application for Test Environment.
   
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
 Creating a web application for a test environment is essential to provide developers and testers with a dedicated platform to simulate, test, and validate software functionalities. The challenge lies in building an easy-to-use, scalable, and efficient application that supports realistic testing scenarios, automates workflows, and ensures smooth collaboration while minimizing setup and maintenance efforts.

# Step 1:
Launch an EC2 instance in AWS using an Amazon Linux 2 AMI with a Security Group allowing HTTP and SSH traffic.
# Step 2:
Connect to the instance using SSH and install a web server like Apache
# Step 3:
Create a simple HTML file in the server's default directory with basic content for testing.
# Step 4:
Access the instance's public IP in a browser to verify the HTML page is displayed.

## COMMANDS
